Project: Predicting Medal Counts in the Olympics using Linear Regression Model

# Project Overview
In this tutorial, I will guide you through the entire process of building a beginner-level machine learning project. This includes formulating a hypothesis, setting up the model, and evaluating the error. 
I will be using an engaging dataset - historical Olympic games data. My goal is to predict the number of medals a country will win based on historical and current data.

# Steps of a Machine Learning Project
Most machine learning projects follow a similar framework, which I will adhere to in this tutorial. This framework will guide you in approaching any machine learning problem effectively.

## Project Steps:

  1) Formulate a hypothesis.
  2) Find and explore the data. (If necessary) Reshape the data to suit your prediction target.
  3) Clean the data for machine learning.
  4) Select an error metric.
  5) Split the data into training and testing sets.
  6) Train a model.
  7) Evaluate the model's performance.
